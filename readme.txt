# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ORIGINARIA is a marketplace platform for organic and natural products from Peru, connecting local producers with conscious consumers. The platform promotes fair trade, sustainability, and economic development of Peruvian communities.

## Architecture

This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website with the following structure:

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS
- **Assets**: Static files (CSS, JS, images, fonts)
- **Multi-user interfaces**: Public marketplace, vendor dashboard, admin panel
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach

### Key Directories

- `public/` - Public-facing pages (landing, marketplace, product details)
- `vendor/` - Vendor dashboard and management interfaces
- `admin/` - Administrative panel for platform management
- `assets/` - Static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)
- `components/` - Reusable HTML components
- `config/` - Configuration files (currently empty)

## Development

### No Build Process
This project uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no build pipeline. Changes are made directly to source files.

### File Organization

#### CSS Architecture
- `main.css` - Global styles and CSS variables
- `public.css` - Public-facing page styles
- `vendor.css` - Vendor dashboard styles
- `admin.css` - Admin panel styles

#### JavaScript Architecture
- `main.js` - Core utilities, API client, notifications, validation
- `public.js` - Public page functionality
- `vendor.js` - Vendor dashboard functionality
- `admin.js` - Admin panel functionality
- `components.js` - Reusable component definitions

### Key JavaScript Features

The main.js file provides:
- **ORIGINARIA global object** with config, cache, state management
- **Utils** - Formatting, validation, DOM utilities
- **API client** with authentication and error handling
- **Notifications system** with toast notifications
- **Validation framework** with form validation
- **Storage wrapper** for localStorage with expiration
- **Components** - Modal, confirm dialogs, loading overlays

### User Types & Interfaces

1. **Public Users**: Browse products, view details, register/login
2. **Vendors**: Product management, sales tracking, analytics
3. **Admins**: Platform management, user moderation, system settings

### Localization
- Primary language: Spanish (Peru)
- Currency: PEN (Peruvian Sol)
- Date/time: Peru timezone
- Phone validation: Peruvian format (+51)

## File Conventions

- HTML files use semantic structure with accessibility considerations
- CSS uses BEM-like naming conventions
- JavaScript follows ES6+ standards
- All files include header comments with purpose and author info
- Placeholder content for images and logos throughout

## Important Notes

- No package.json or build tools - this is a static website
- Configuration files in `/config/` are currently empty
- Images are placeholder divs with descriptive text
- All monetary values should use PEN currency
- Forms include client-side validation with the Validation framework
- API endpoints are prefixed with `/api` (backend not included in this repo)
